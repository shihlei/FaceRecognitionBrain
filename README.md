# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

• Developed a responsive web app that people can sign in to enter an image, and the website will detect faces in the image. </br>
• Created website that is using JavaScript and react, and the front-end used image recognition API to detect photo.</br>
• Build a server in Node.js and Express that is working with PostgreSQL, so that there’s memory for user to register
and back-end will remember.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

## Use URL to test it!
1. Register (Use the web app link on Github page that I deployed)
2. upload any image with face on it (https://attach.setn.com/newsimages/2019/11/10/2234954-PH.jpg)
3. see the result!
